# YSSoundEffect
An iOS app created as part of my first project in the iOS Nanodegree program ( PitchPerfect )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sound Effect app allows users to record a sound using the device's microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with effects.
